            cite from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland - Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit-Hole"

            Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do:
            once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations
            in it, `and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'
            So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and
            stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking
            the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

            There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the
            Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred
            to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the
            Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice
            started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
            waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after
            it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
